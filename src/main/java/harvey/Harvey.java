/**
 * The Harvey chatbot.
 * <p>
 * Harvey stores three kinds of task ({@link Todo}, {@link Deadline} and {@link Event}),
 * lists them back on request, remembers which have been marked as done, and saves the
 * list to disk after every change. Input it cannot carry out is reported through
 * {@link HarveyException} instead of crashing.
 * <p>
 * This class is only the conductor. Reading and printing belong to {@link Ui}, working out
 * what the user meant belongs to {@link Parser}, holding the tasks belongs to
 * {@link TaskList}, and the file belongs to {@link Storage}. What is left here is the
 * order those four are used in.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways in. {@link #run()} drives the text interface, reading and printing
 * until the user stops. {@link #getResponse(String)} answers a single line and hands the
 * reply back, which is what the graphical interface needs: the window, not Harvey, decides
 * when the next line arrives.
